# Street View Image View Direction Recognition

In this repo I used the [Mapillarly Places Dataset](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/places) to collect Street View images with Metadata. I used this Metadata to train a model to detect whether its a [Panoramic Model](Pano_Detection.md), whether it's shot by [day or night](Night_Day_Detection.md) and the viewdirection of the model.
